<h1 align="center">CipherShield</h1>
<h2 align="left">Executive Summary</h2>
Cipher Shield is a cybersecurity firm providing solutions for safer wireless networks of medium-sized healthcare enterprises. 
We recognize that healthcare organizations handle plenty of sensitive patient information, which could make them attractive targets for cyber threats. 
Our primary mission is to ensure these networks are safe from potential threats. 
In order to accomplish this, we conduct thorough penetration testing on wifi networks to verify the integrity of their passwords, making sure that they have not been compromised or licked; especially private networks utilized by these businesses.
<br></br>
Our small team diligently gathers data from various sources, actively searching for hashed passwords that may be available. 
By testing our clients’ systems, we can make certain that their passwords remain uncompromised and shielded from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.
<br></br>
The company's target market includes small and medium-sized healthcare companies as they might not have the resources or expertise to effectively protect their sensitive information from malicious actors. 
The company will focus on businesses that store sensitive information, such as healthcare data, and that need to comply with industry or regulatory standards.
<br></br>
Small and medium-sized healthcare businesses should care about penetration testing and information security to meet compliance requirements, protect sensitive data, maintain their reputation and trust, minimize financial risks, proactively manage risks, and ensure business continuity. 
By prioritizing security, these organizations can safeguard patient information and demonstrate their commitment to maintaining a secure environment for their stakeholders.

<h2 align="left">Core Concept</h2>
Cipher Shield’s core concept revolves around creating secure wifi network solutions tailored to the different needs of medium-sized businesses, with a particular focus on healthcare organizations. Our company understands that these organizations handle millions of sensitive patient information and data. Healthcare Dive has noted that “More than 52 million people* had their private health information exposed in 2022 in more than 700 breaches, up from about 6 million people in 2010.” Data breaches in this industry have drastically increased and we strive to minimize this number with our services. By performing penetration testing, Cipher Shield can identify the weaknesses in an enterprise’s network. We provide a variety of tools and techniques to simulate attacks on our clients' systems, identify vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations for improving security. Under the owner's consent, white-hat hackers like us, aim to identify any vulnerabilities or security issues the company’s current system has.
 The company's primary service is penetration testing, which involves simulating attacks on a business's computer systems and identifying vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors. The company will also provide additional security services, such as network security assessments, vulnerability assessments, and compliance consulting in the future.
Solution creation of an app with the power of encrypting passwords, restricting access to unknown Mac addresses, and adding on trusted devices and WLAN. 

<h2 align="left">Target Market</h2>
Small and medium-sized healthcare businesses should prioritize penetration testing and the security of their information due to the following reasons: <br></br>
<li><b> Compliance Requirements:</b> Healthcare organizations are subject to various industry-specific regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States. These regulations mandate the protection of sensitive patient data and require organizations to implement security measures, including regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, to ensure compliance. Failing to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties and damage to the organization's reputation.<br></br>
<li><b> Data Breach Risks:</b>  Healthcare companies store vast amounts of sensitive patient information, including medical records, personally identifiable information (PII), and financial data. This makes them lucrative targets for cybercriminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to valuable data. A successful data breach can lead to severe consequences, such as compromised patient privacy, identity theft, financial losses, and legal liabilities.<br></br>
<li><b> Reputation and Trust:</b>  A data breach or security incident can significantly damage the reputation and trust of a healthcare organization. Patients, clients, and partners expect their healthcare providers to handle their information securely. If an organization fails to protect sensitive data, it can lose credibility, resulting in the loss of patients, business opportunities, and partnerships. Demonstrating a commitment to security through regular penetration testing helps build trust with stakeholders.<br></br>
<li><b> Financial Impact:</b>  Recovering from a data breach can be costly for small and medium-sized healthcare businesses. They may face expenses related to incident response, legal proceedings, regulatory fines, and potential lawsuits. Additionally, there can be indirect financial impacts, such as loss of business opportunities, increased insurance premiums, and the need for remediation measures to prevent future incidents. <br></br>
<li><b> Proactive Risk Management:</b>  Penetration testing plays a vital role in proactive risk management. By identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their systems and networks, healthcare organizations can take proactive steps to address those issues before they are exploited by malicious actors. <br></br>
<li><b> Business Continuity:</b>  Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical systems and data is crucial for the smooth operation of healthcare businesses. Penetration testing helps identify vulnerabilities that could disrupt essential services, compromise patient care, or cause downtime. By identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities, organizations can enhance their resilience and ensure uninterrupted operations.</li>

<h2 align="left">“How to” Step</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Find Online Leaked Passwords:<br></br>
    Search for leaked passwords online, including the Dark Web, using reliable sources and tools.<br></br>
   <li>Create a Password List:<br></br>
    Compile a text file containing the leaked passwords you found in the previous step.<br></br>
   <li>Identify WiFi Password Requirements:<br></br>
    Determine the specific requirements for the target WiFi network's password, such as special characters, lowercase and uppercase letters, and minimum and maximum length.<br></br>
   <li>Sort Password List:<br></br>
    Sort the password list based on the identified requirements (e.g., minimum length of 8 and maximum length of 63) to narrow down the options.<br></br>
   <li>Launch Kali Linux and Access Wireless Attacks:<br></br>
    Click on the Kali Linux logo and navigate to the wireless attacks section.<br></br>
   <li>Open Fern WiFi Cracker:<br></br>
    Locate and open the pre-installed application on Kali Linux called Fern WiFi Cracker.<br></br>
   <li>Provide Root Access (if required):<br></br>
    If prompted, enter your password to gain root access to the Fern WiFi Cracker application.<br></br>
   <li>Select Network Type:<br></br>
    Choose the appropriate network type from the options provided (e.g., WLAN0) within the Fern WiFi Cracker application.<br></br>
